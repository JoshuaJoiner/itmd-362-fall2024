              Students in this course will learn the importance of 
              human-computer interaction design and the effectiveness of user-centered design. The 
              course will cover a survey of methods frequently used by the HCI profession, such as 
              usability testing and prototyping, as well as general design principles and how to use 
              design guidelines. A particular emphasis will be placed on usability for Web site 
              engineering, and students will apply knowledge from the field in the design and 
              construction of user-centered Web sites.

              All major projects for this course will be submitted via Basecamp.
              Submissions should <b>not</b> include attachments, but rather URLs
              pointing to your project’s GitHub repository and live link.
              Examples will be demonstrated in class.

              <b>All HTML and CSS in projects and lab submissions must pass validation</b> with the
              <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML validator</a> and <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3c CSS validator</a>.
              Any work whose HTML does not validate will receive a 50&#x25;-point reduction, failing grade. Get in the habit early of validating 
              each time before you commit your work to GitHub.
            </p>
            <p>
              I do not accept late work. All work must be submitted before the date and time specified
              in each project description.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will check to see that you are adding proper summaries of your GitHub commits. You are also expected to help other students on Basecamp. 
              This means polite give-and-take discussions of code. Do not discuss anything else on Basecamp. Practice professional and supportive critiquing.

              As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold
              <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty">the Code of Academic Honesty</a>
              as described in the
              <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook">IIT Student Handbook</a>). All
              work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and digital page
              design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use of
              open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as
              legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage,
              dissemination, and other use of data from third-party sources must conform to the
              source’s terms of service, licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.

            <p>
              If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in
              part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before
              the work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who
              violates the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with
              a failing grade, and I will report the student to the Dean of the School of Applied
              Technology, who may take additional disciplinary action, including reporting
              violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or Graduate Academic Affairs.

              harassment among students, staff, or faculty. Sexual harassment of a 
              student by a faculty member or sexual harassment of an employee by a 
              supervisor is particularly serious. Such conduct may easily create an 
              intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.
